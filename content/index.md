## Memex Working Group Notes

Hello and welcome to the Memex Working Group [[Digital Garden]]. Here we document out projects, research, tutorials and more all related to using knowledge tools to enhance the lives of living human beings.

#### Goal of Memex Working Group

Develop a "Community of Practice" that shares and cultivates behaviours of life enhancing knowledge tool use.

This is a synthesis of [[Paul Mullins|Paul]]'s three goals for [mememaps.net](https://mememaps.net/) which are,

1. [Curate, Promote, and Develop software that encourages people to become better versions of themselves](https://mememaps.net/909c405d-f9fe-444e-ac84-7e25ebe8cb8d)
2. [Provide a medium for user data that is not confined to specific applications, platforms, or protocols](https://mememaps.net/6a8c5d7d-f1d9-44df-ba30-556c8301830f)
3. [Encourage people to use, develop, and integrate meme maps to help make sense of the human experience](https://mememaps.net/af09736e-8625-4d26-b005-a772f5d117c8)
