| The origin-tracking chain of a mnemegram—what it derives from, what derives from it | **[[Provenance]]**            |

## Information Types

| Term                       | Concept                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Captured Information**   | Mnemegrams and assertions created through agent inscription of experience                                    |
| **Systemic Information**   | Assertions and structures that emerge from the operation of the memex itself                                 |
| **Generative Information** | Mnemegrams and assertions produced through creative, analytic, or synthetic engagement with existing content |

## Essential Properties
