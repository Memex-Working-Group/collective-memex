# 100 Speculative Memex Use Cases

## Document Overview

This document presents 100 use cases for a memex system—a personal and collective knowledge management infrastructure inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1945 vision. The core insight of the memex is **associative trails**: not just storing information, but preserving the pathways through information, making the act of intellectual wandering itself into an artifact.

These use cases push beyond pedestrian productivity tools toward the conceptually ambitious, culturally transformative, and philosophically engaged.

---

## I. Temporal Self-Relations

_Relating to past and future versions of yourself as distinct entities_

### 1. Future Self Correspondence

Write to yourself at specific future dates, creating a dialogue across time where past-you makes predictions present-you must confront.

> Human note: see https://www.futureme.org

### 2. Identity Breakpoints

Mark the moments you became someone different—not continuous growth but discontinuous rupture—preserving the you that died when you changed.

> Human note: I did this writing experiment once, defining the eras of my life.

### 3. Temporal Palimpsest Navigation

Move through your own past thinking at different depths, reading the present over the past over the deeper past, experiencing your mind as archaeological site.

> Human note: some limited experience with revisiting handwritten notes and appending new reflection in different ink.

### 4. Prophylactic Memory

Pre-emptively document experiences you know you'll later want to deny or minimize, creating evidence against your own future revisionism.

### 5. Stupidity Preservation

Document your past errors with enough fidelity that you can't pretend you always knew better, preventing the inflation of your cognitive self-image.

> Human note: how humbling.

### 6. Temporal Arbitrage

Identify patterns in your past thinking that predict future interests, letting you invest attention in ideas before you realize you'll need them.

> Human note: I do support the conceptual practice of an attention microeconomy, or the microeconomics of attention.

---

## II. Cognitive Origin Tracing

_Forensic investigation of where thoughts, beliefs, and desires come from_

### 7. Ideological Autopsy

Trace exactly when and how you came to believe what you believe—the specific trail that led you to your politics, your aesthetics, your gods—making radicalization or deradicalization visible as path-dependent drift.

> Human note: I call it your semenalia.

### 8. Cognitive Debt Ledger

Track which ideas you've borrowed from whom, which thoughts are truly yours, which are inherited furniture—forcing confrontation with how little of your mind you actually built.

> Human note: memetic provenance. Aren't many popular sociology books attempts to do this narratively?

### 9. Desire Forensics

Trace wants to their origins—which desires are actually yours, which were installed by advertising, trauma, social pressure—creating a verified chain of custody for your own preferences.

> Human note: salacious kink origins

### 10. Influence Mapping

Trace how every person you've met has shaped your thinking, creating an honest accounting of intellectual debt that most people never examine.

> Human note: I kept a influencial heros log for some time, with in real life secret role models, mentors, and authors, stories, and example behaviour which had impacted my belief structure.

### 11. Cognitive Colonialism Audit

Examine whose conceptual frameworks have colonized your thinking, which languages of thought were imposed versus chosen, what indigenous categories you've abandoned.

> Human note: I once tried to document all forms of bias so I could troubleshoot my thinking. If I had trails of my experiences I would have a log I could inspect.

### 12. Institutional Autobiography

Trace how organizations and systems you've passed through have shaped your thinking, making visible the bureaucratic and architectural origins of your mental habits.

> Human note: uhhh https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/

### 13. Class Consciousness Mapping

Trace how economic position has shaped your thought-world, which ideas are luxuries of your class, which concerns are invisible from your position.

> Human note: and maybe https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0875113/

---

## III. Relational Cognition

_Thinking as fundamentally shared, merged, or interpersonal_

### 14. Argument Archaeology

Reconstruct the full genealogy of a disagreement with a loved one across years, revealing how current fights are palimpsests of older wounds wearing new masks.

> Human note: woof. gotta heal: ISBN 0061129739, bell hooks, ISBN: 9780807014295, ISBN: 9780670785933

### 15. Collaborative Hallucination

Merge trails with another person so thoroughly that neither can remember whose thought was whose—creating genuinely shared cognition rather than just shared documents.

> Human note: I want this. Some of my best work is the collaborations on whiteboards with others who bring their own worlds to bear against our quest.

### 16. Intimacy Versioning

Preserve the exact texture of a relationship at a specific moment—not just what you knew but how you knew each other—creating restorable snapshots of closeness.

> Human note: approaches capturing in ways of rich nuance like https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/ or https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937, and https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6425148

### 17. Cognitive Mutual Aid

Form networks where people maintain each other's trails—remembering for each other, providing backup cognition during crisis, distributing the burden of personhood.

> Human note: oral history blockchain ~ whakapapa https://www.journal.mai.ac.nz/system/files/maireview/56-65-1-PB.pdf, applicable for alzheimer's

### 18. Silence Mapping

Track what you chose not to say—the unspoken in every conversation, the self-censorship patterns, the shape of your social inhibition over time.

> Human note: possible trauma or anxiety resolution, agency development, or critical insight

### 19. Care Labor Accounting

Document who remembers what for whom, the invisible cognitive work of maintaining connection, making emotional labor visible.

> Human note: reminds me of Sousou no Frieren

### 20. Mutual Modeling Divergence

Each person's model of the other compared—revealing where you misunderstand each other and where misunderstanding is generative.

> Human note: this would really help with some of my friendships, alignment drift becomes hardship. It would be powerful in utility based context for work alignment and strategy portfolio management.

---

## IV. Shadow Preservation

_Maintaining records of the forbidden, shameful, or denied_

### 21. Shame Topology

Map the forbidden territories of your own thinking—subjects you avoid, connections you refuse to make—and navigate them like a surgeon navigating scar tissue.

> Human note: …I may have done something like this when I prestiged and reset my life.

### 22. Heresy Preservation

Maintain a protected space for thoughts you're not supposed to have—a cognitive samizdat that can't be surveilled or self-censored, preserving intellectual freedom under conditions of ideological capture.

> Human note: mmm… yeah, but maybe therapy too.

### 23. Thought Crime Preservation

Maintain a record of your genuinely antisocial ideation—not to act on but to prevent the revisionist history of pretending you never thought such things.

> Human note: ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

### 24. Contradiction Gardening

Deliberately cultivate and protect mutually exclusive beliefs, refusing premature synthesis, letting paradox remain generative rather than demanding resolution.

> Human note: I think there is semantic innovations to be found in practices like this.

### 25. Resistance Genealogy

Trace every act of refusal, every no, every withdrawal of consent, creating a counter-history of your opposition alongside your participation.

> Human note: It is a great maturity to turn down things. Perhaps honouring the practice would support the individual's development. Also, there is this in the DSM-5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder, some recording may help inference on one's mental disposition.

---

## V. Mortality and Witness

_Cognition in relation to death, loss, and testimony_

### 26. Grief Cartography

Map the topology of mourning—how thoughts of the dead spiral, which memories trigger which, creating a navigable terrain of loss that transforms grief from formless ache into traversable geography.

> Human note: I feel like we would benefit from a psychologist and sociological expertise in our memex efforts.

### 27. Witness Protocols

Create trails specifically designed to survive you, testimony for futures where you won't exist to clarify what you meant or what you saw.

> Human note: continuity planning.

### 28. Dying Well Documentation

Create trails specifically for the process of terminal illness—cognitive infrastructure for dying, ways of organizing thought when thought itself is failing.

> Human note: playbooks for future need.

### 29. Generational Transmission

Package cognitive trails for inheritance, creating not just wills for possessions but wills for ways of thinking, inheritable epistemic styles.

> Human note: a practice of intentional memetics

### 30. Ancestral Memory Reconstruction

Build trails backward through family history, creating synthetic memories of events you never witnessed but which shaped the cognitive inheritance you carry.

> Human note: This becomes the stuff of fantasy.

### 31. Philosophical Haunting

Let your dead heroes think alongside you—not as chatbots but as preserved cognitive styles, letting Wittgenstein's way of cutting problems loose on your current confusions.

> Human note: I believe may have been exemplified in https://myanimelist.net/anime/790/ergo_proxy/, if one could be properly perserved. It is a narrative idea that comes up often.

---

## VI. Metacognitive Instrumentation

_Tools for observing your own cognitive processes_

### 32. Attention Forensics

Reveal the micro-decisions that led you down rabbit holes—the precise moment curiosity became compulsion, leisure became labor, interest became addiction.

> Human note: I think it could be compelling for granular personal salience tracking. The digital attention industry does this for engagement and conversion, what if it was applied to personal agency and personal enablement rather than external benefit?

### 33. Ontological Drift Detection

Alert you when your fundamental categories are quietly shifting—when "friend" starts meaning something different, when "success" has been redefined without your noticing.

> Human note: this maybe the next 1984 / PsychoPass dystopia.

### 34. Boredom Archaeology

Study the precise structure of your disengagement—what makes you look away, tune out, abandon—revealing the negative space of your attention as its own meaningful territory.

> Human note: again with the inference for one's mental disposition and hacking the microeconomics of attention.

### 35. Recursive Self-Modeling

Build a model of yourself building a model of yourself, creating strange loops of self-representation that reveal blind spots through infinite regress.

### 36. Cognitive Weather Patterns

Identify your mental climate—which thoughts flourish in which moods, which connections only appear under specific emotional conditions, making metacognition meteorological.

> Human note: see affective computing

### 37. Attention Debt Accounting

Track every promise to return to something later, every deferred investigation, every "I'll think about that more"—revealing the unpaid obligations of your intellectual life.

> Human note: microeconomy of attention, attention budgeting

---

## VII. Epistemic Hygiene and Critique

_Examining the political and social contamination of knowledge_

### 38. Tribal Epistemology Exposure

Reveal how your knowledge sources cluster politically, showing which facts you believe because of who told you rather than how they were established.

### 39. Consent Archaeology

Examine every agreement you've ever made—every terms of service, every relational negotiation—revealing the accumulating weight of commitments made without full understanding.

### 40. Paranoia Cartography

Map your threat models and conspiracy theories with enough rigor to distinguish pattern recognition from apophenia, making your fears examinable rather than ambient.

### 41. Anti-Library Cultivation

Track specifically what you haven't read, deliberately maintaining the negative space of your ignorance as a structured resource rather than a shapeless absence.

### 42. Doubt Preservation

Maintain uncertainty against the pressure of faith or certainty, creating protected space for epistemic humility.

---

## VIII. Cognitive Autonomy and Resistance

_Using the memex against dominant systems_

### 43. Cognitive Contraband

Smuggle dangerous ideas through your own psychological defenses by approaching them through unexpected trails that bypass your usual resistance.

### 45. Solidarity Cartography

Map your connections to struggles not your own, tracing how your concerns extend beyond self-interest into genuine care for distant others.

### 46. Counter-Surveillance Archive

Photographs of power photographing you—turning the gaze back on the watchers.

> Human note: I believe Canadian law allows you to request copies of any recording of you.

### 47. Gaslighting Defense

Immutable record of what actually happened, proof against those who would make you doubt your own experience.

> Human note: high utility for those in vulnerable positions (work, abusive relationship, legal context) reminds me of contemporaneous notes, and advice for dealing with psychopaths in the work place

---

## IX. Non-Human and Alien Cognition

_Interfacing with radically different minds_

### 48. Xenocognitive Translation

Attempt to follow trails created by minds organized completely differently—autistic, schizophrenic, animal, artificial—treating incomprehension as data.

> Human note: applied theory of mind concepts, another potential area for semantic innovations.

### 49. Animal Companion Epistemology

What your pets have taught you, how they've shaped your thought—cognition that emerges in interspecies relationship.

> Human note: this is just journalling, made up to be bigger brained than it is.

### 50. Plant Time Thinking

Cognitive patterns learned from gardening, forest, seasons—thinking at non-human temporal scales.

### 51. AI Trail Walking

Following paths through information created by artificial intelligences, experiencing non-human grammar of association.

> Human note: yes. I think this is what attracts me as the potential in the library of babel, meaning outside of reach within our pathways. Are there islands of meaning we can't travel to with our current capabilities?

## Appendix: Brainstorming Conversation

This document was developed through iterative conversation with Claude (Anthropic). The process proceeded as follows:

**Phase 1: Initial Generation**
Starting from the provided prompt framework, 48 initial use cases were generated, calibrated against the examples provided (e.g., "Trauma Topology," "Archaeological Desire," "Cognitive Xenobiology") and explicitly avoiding pedestrian productivity features.

**Phase 2: Categorical Analysis**
The initial 48 use cases were analyzed to identify emergent clusters:

- Temporal Self-Relations
- Cognitive Origin Tracing
- Relational Cognition
- Shadow Preservation
- Mortality and Witness
- Metacognitive Instrumentation
- Epistemic Hygiene/Critique
- Cognitive Autonomy/Resistance
- Non-Human and Alien Cognition
- Embodied and Affective Cognition
- Temporal Debt and Deferral
- Generative Epistemics

**Phase 3: Gap Identification**
Analysis revealed underexplored territories:

- Dream and liminal states
- Spatial/environmental cognition
- Aesthetic and sensory dimensions
- Play, humor, and absurdity
- Interspecies/ecological relations
- Economic dimensions of thought
- Linguistic and pre-linguistic experience
- Agonistic/competitive cognition

**Phase 4: Modality Expansion**
Exploration of capture modalities beyond text:

- Photographic/image capture
- Auditory capture
- Video capture
- 3D/spatial capture
- DNA sequencing and biological capture
- Physiological/biometric capture
- Environmental/atmospheric capture
- Linked open data integration
- Cryptographic content addressing
- Instrumental patterns of memory

**Phase 5: Scale Expansion**
Exploration of memory at different scales:

- Dyadic (two people)
- Small group (3-12)
- Organizational (Dunbar-scale)
- Community/network
- Civilizational

**Phase 6: Teleological Analysis**
The question "What is memory for?" yielded purposes:

- Memory as Witness
- Memory as Orientation
- Memory as Learning
- Memory as Resistance
- Memory as Communion
- Memory as Proprioception
- Memory as Obligation
- Memory as Generativity

**Phase 7: Final Synthesis**
Integration of all phases into 100 categorized use cases with emphasis on the speculative, philosophically engaged, and culturally transformative.

---

## Appendix: Design Principles

These use cases share certain commitments:

**Trails over Items**: The pathway through information is as valuable as the information itself.

**Persistence with Purpose**: Everything preserved serves some function—witness, learning, resistance, communion.

**Reflexivity**: The memex observes itself; metacognition is first-class.

**Scale-Awareness**: Memory operates differently at different scales, from intimate to civilizational.

**Temporal Thickness**: The present is layered over multiple pasts, all navigable.

**Political Consciousness**: Memory is never neutral; it serves interests, enables resistance, encodes power.

**Embodiment**: Cognition is not disembodied; the flesh shapes the thought.

**Mortality**: The memex exists in relation to death—of persons, relationships, cultures, species.

**Generativity**: Memory is not just archive but compost—material for creating futures.
