# Memex Ontology: Examples Supplement

This supplement provides concrete instantiations of each element in the memex ontology.

---

## Primitive Elements: Examples

### Mnemegram

The fundamental unit of capture—the shadow of lived experience cast into information space.

|Example|Description|
|---|---|
|A journal entry|An individual's inscription of their experience of a day, an event, a feeling|
|A photograph|Visual capture of a moment, a scene, a face|
|A recipe|Codified memory of how to prepare a dish, transmitted from experience|
|A task definition|A group's inscription of work to be done, capturing intent and context|
|A meeting transcript|Record of a conversation, preserving what was said|
|A poem|Expressive inscription of inner experience, shaped by interpretation|
|An experiment log|Scientist's record of procedure and outcome|
|A bookmark with annotation|Captured encounter with a resource, with added context|
|A voice memo|Audio inscription of thought in the moment|
|A sketch|Visual thinking externalized, capturing a nascent idea|

### Referent

Persistent entities referenced across mnemegrams.

|Example|Description|
|---|---|
|"Running"|A concept referenced in training logs, health reflections, race memories|
|"The Hague"|A place referenced in travel journals, news captures, meeting notes|
|"Coca-Cola"|An entity referenced in brand analyses, personal memories, cultural critiques|
|"Maria"|A person referenced across correspondence, photographs, shared memories|
|"Project Atlas"|An organizational entity referenced in task definitions, reports, retrospectives|
|"Grief"|An abstract concept referenced in journal entries, therapeutic notes, poetry|
|"2024-07-15"|A date referenced across multiple mnemegrams as temporal anchor|
|"Kitchen renovation"|A project referenced in plans, receipts, photographs, reflections|

### Assertion

Claims made about mnemegrams, referents, or relations.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "responds to"    | This mnemegram is a response to that mnemegram                |
| "contradicts"    | This assertion contradicts that earlier assertion             |
| "elaborates"     | This entry elaborates on a previous sketch                    |
| "blocks"         | This task blocks that task                                    |
| "reminds me of"  | Associative connection between two mnemegrams                 |
| "is part of"     | This mnemegram belongs to that collection                     |
| "was present at" | This referent (person) was present at this event (mnemegram)  |
| "derives from"   | This generated mnemegram derives from those source mnemegrams |

### Context

## Integrated Example: A Single Mnemegram in Full Context

**The Mnemegram:** A journal entry written on 2024-07-15 about a conversation with Maria about career change.

**Schema Applied:** Journal entry schema (date, mood, events, reflections, connections)

**Referents:**

- Spatial: "Conversation occurred at the café on Main Street"
- Emotional: "Written while feeling both anxious and hopeful"
- Relational: "Responds to entry from 2024-06-01 about feeling stuck"
- Epistemic: "Represents my thinking before I made the decision"

**Relations:**

- "responds to" → Entry from 2024-06-01

**Provenance:**

- Primary inscription (not derived from other mnemegrams)
- Created by agent (me)
- Not yet transmitted to others

**Collections:**
