# An Ontology of Memex

## Preamble

This document articulates the [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), functional, and [teleological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) structure of the memex—a system for capturing and connecting the shadows of lived experience in information space.

The framework proceeds in three layers:

- **Essential Properties**: What a memex _is_—the necessary conditions for something to be a memex
- **Functional Capacities**: What a memex _does_—the operations it performs
- **Teleological Orientations**: What a memex _is for_—the ends toward which it is instrumental

These three layers are **co-determining**: each shapes and is shaped by the others. No layer is foundational.

## Core Vocabulary

### Primitive Elements

| Term              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Mnemegram]]** | The fundamental unit of capture. A mnemegram is the shadow of a meme or memory cast into information space—what remains when lived experience passes through the medium of inscription. A mnemegram is not the experience itself but its trace, its mark, its written residue.           |
| **[[Referent]]**  | A symbolic representation of something asserted to persist across mnemegrams. Referents are the stable entities—terms, places, identities, concepts—that mnemegrams point to, describe, and accumulate around. Referents may be inside the memex, referenced by it, or emergent from it. |
| **[[Assertion]]** | A claim made about a mnemegram, referent, or relation. Assertions are how information says something—claims about context, temporality, meaning, connection.                                                                                                                             |
| **[[Agent]]**     | That which interacts with the memex. Agents create mnemegrams, make assertions, retrieve, interpret, and generate. Agents are external to the memex but leave traces within it. The agent may be individual, collective, institutional, or other.                                        |
| **[[Schema]]**    | A vocabulary or structure through which mnemegrams and assertions become interpretable. Schemas are applied to or emergent from memex content. Without schema, mnemegrams are noise; with schema, they become meaning.                                                                   |

### Derived Structures

| Term                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Relation]]**              | A connection between mnemegrams, between referents, or between mnemegrams and referents. Relations are assertions of connection—typed, directional, meaningful.  |
| **[[Context]]**               | A set of assertions that situate a mnemegram—temporal, spatial, relational, conditional. Context is what makes a mnemegram intelligible within a larger frame.   |
| **[[concepts/Index\|Index]]** | A structure enabling retrieval of mnemegrams via referents, assertions, relations, or other mnemegrams. The index is what makes the memex navigable.             |
| **[[Collection]]**            | A bounded set of mnemegrams, often sharing schema or purpose. Collections are how mnemegrams are grouped for coherence or use.                                   |
| **[[Provenance]]**            | The origin-tracking chain of a mnemegram—what it derives from, what derives from it, the history of its transformation. Provenance is memory of memory's making. |

### Information Types by Provenance

| Type                       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Captured Information**   | Mnemegrams and assertions created through agent inscription of experience. This is primary content—the direct shadow of lived experience.                                                       |
| **Systemic Information**   | Assertions and structures that emerge from the operation of the memex itself—timestamps, versioning, structural metadata. This is information the system generates through its own functioning. |
| **Generative Information** | Mnemegrams and assertions produced by agents through creative, analytic, or synthetic engagement with existing memex content. This is derivative content—new shadows cast from old shadows.     |

## Essential Properties

The essential properties define the **necessary conditions** for something to be a memex. Without these, a system may store information but does not function as memex.

| Code   | Property              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **E1** | Mnemegram Primitivity | The memex holds mnemegrams as its fundamental content. Without mnemegrams—shadows of experience cast into information—there is no memex, only storage.                               |
| **E2** | Assertive Capacity    | The memex supports assertions about mnemegrams. A system that holds content but cannot hold claims about content is not yet memex. Assertions enable meaning, context, and relation. |
| **E3** | Referent Capacity     | The memex can represent persistent referents that are referenced across mnemegrams. This enables recognition, linking, and accumulation around stable entities.                      |
| **E4** | Retrievability        | Mnemegrams can be found and accessed. A memex that captures but cannot surface is not functioning as memex. Retrievability is the condition of usability.                            |
| **E5** | Interpretability      | The memex operates through schemas that render mnemegrams meaningful. Raw information without interpretive frame is not yet memex-functional. Schema transforms noise into signal.   |
| **E6** | Agency                | Agents engage with the memex. The memex without agent is inert substrate. Agency is what animates the system—creating, retrieving, interpreting, generating.                         |

---

## Functional Capacities

The functional capacities define **what a memex does**—the operations it performs. Functions are neutral instruments; teleological orientation is applied by agents.

| Code     | Function     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F1**   | Inscription  | Creating mnemegrams from experience. The agent has a meme or memory; the memex receives its shadow. Inscription is the foundational function—without it, no content enters the system.                           |
| **F2**   | Assertion    | Making claims about mnemegrams, referents, and relations. Through assertion, raw inscription becomes contextualized, linked, temporalized, meaningful.                                                           |
| **F3**   | Indexing     | Creating structures that enable retrieval. Indexing organizes mnemegrams and referents such that they can be found. Without indexing, the memex is an unsearchable heap.                                         |
| **F4**   | Retrieval    | Returning mnemegrams to agents on request. The agent queries; the memex responds. Retrieval is the reciprocal of inscription—what goes in must be able to come out.                                              |
| **F4.1** | Surfacing    | System-initiated presentation of relevant mnemegrams. Unlike retrieval (agent-initiated), surfacing is the memex offering content based on context, relevance, or time. The memex proposes rather than responds. |
| **F5**   | Relating     | Establishing relations between mnemegrams and referents. Through relating, the memex becomes a web rather than a list—connections multiply meaning.                                                              |
| **F6**   | Versioning   | Tracking states and changes across time. The memex remembers its own history—what mnemegrams were, how they changed, what was added or removed.                                                                  |
| **F7**   | Generation   | Producing new mnemegrams from existing content. Agents engage creatively, analytically, or synthetically with what exists to produce what did not exist. The memex grows from within.                            |
| **F8**   | Transmission | Making mnemegrams available beyond their original context. Sharing, publishing, inheriting—transmission enables mnemegrams to travel across boundaries.                                                          |
| **F9**   | Protection   | Controlling access and maintaining integrity. The memex has boundaries; protection determines who can inscribe, retrieve, modify, and what remains secure against threat.                                        |

## Teleological Orientations

The teleological orientations define **what a memex is for**—the ends toward which it is instrumental. Telos is applied by agents; the same function may serve different ends depending on use.

| Code    | Telos               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T1**  | To Persist          | Making experience outlast the moment. The memex exists so that what happened does not simply vanish. Persistence is the most fundamental telos—without it, no other end is achievable.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **T2**  | To Accumulate       | Enabling knowledge to compound over time. Mnemegrams build on mnemegrams; understanding deepens through accretion. The memex makes learning cumulative rather than repetitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **T3**  | To Connect          | Revealing relations between mnemegrams, referents, and moments. The memex shows how things link—ideas to ideas, events to events, persons to persons. Connection transforms isolated facts into structured understanding.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **T4**  | To Orient           | Situating the present through knowledge of the past. The memex enables agents to know where they are by knowing where they have been. Orientation is memory in service of navigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **T5**  | To Hold Accountable | Making action consequential across time. The memex enables judgment, evidence, promise-keeping. What was done remains available for reckoning; commitments persist beyond the moment of their making.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **T6**  | To Transmit         | Carrying memory across separation—temporal (to future selves, future generations), spatial (to distant others), ontological (to different kinds of agents). Transmission defeats the boundaries that would contain knowledge.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **T7**  | To Reflect          | Making cognition visible to itself. The memex enables thinking about thinking, memory of memory. Through reflection, agents can observe their own patterns, track their own drift, audit their own assumptions.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **T8**  | To Generate         | Providing material for future creation. Past mnemegrams become compost for new thought, art, action. The memex is not merely archive but fertile ground—what was feeds what might be.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **T9**  | To Commune          | Enabling presence and intimacy across absence. The memex is infrastructure for being-with: shared memory as the basis for relationship, solidarity, mourning, belonging. Through communion, memory becomes a form of togetherness.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **T10** | To Identify         | Sustaining continuity of self through persistent memory. The memex provides the substrate for identity—individual or collective—by maintaining the thread of experience that constitutes "same over time."                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **T11** | To Forget           | Structured release, letting go, making space. The memex can serve forgetting as well as remembering—by making explicit what can be released, by enabling intentional deletion, by supporting the work of moving on. _(Note: The relationship between To Forget and To Commune remains undecided; forgetting may be understood as a subset of communion—the shared work of letting go.)_ |

## Co-Determination of Layers

The three layers—Essential, Functional, Teleological—do not stand in simple hierarchy. They **co-determine** each other:

### Essential ↔ Functional

- Essential properties **enable** functional capacities: you cannot have Retrieval without Retrievability
- Functional capacities **actualize** essential properties: Retrievability is meaningless without Retrieval occurring
- Functional use **reveals** essential properties: we know it is memex because it functions as memex

### Functional ↔ Teleological

- Functions are **neutral instruments**; telos is **applied by agent**
- Certain functions **afford** certain teloi more readily: Relating affords To Connect; Versioning affords To Reflect
- Teleological orientation **selects** which functions to develop and emphasize

### Essential ↔ Teleological

- Essential properties **constrain** possible teloi: without Mnemegram Primitivity, no telos depending on mnemegrams is achievable
- Teleological commitment **shapes** what essentials are prioritized: a memex designed for To Hold Accountable emphasizes different essentials than one designed for To Commune
- The ends we seek **reveal** which properties are truly essential

### The Three as Perspectives

The same memex can be viewed from three angles:

| Perspective  | Question           | Answer Form             |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Essential    | What is this?      | Ontological description |
| Functional   | What does this do? | Operational description |
| Teleological | What is this for?  | Purposive description   |

No perspective is more fundamental. Together, they constitute a complete account.

## Summary Definition

> **A memex is a system that holds mnemegrams—the shadows of lived experience inscribed into information space—and supports their assertion, relation, retrieval, and generation, enabling agents to persist, accumulate, connect, orient, account, transmit, reflect, generate, commune, and identify across time.**

Or more compactly:

> **A memex is infrastructure for making experience consequential beyond the moment and the agent.**
