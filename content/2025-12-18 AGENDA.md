    - Everyone is required to have between 1 and 5 use cases they want to describe, we go through each person to get their use cases tallying next to each use case if a person, already performs that practice or is interested developing that practice
    
- Get people to describe what success for that use case means to them
- Experiment Hypothesis Time,
    
    - I want to see people assign themselves quests in the mememaps.net discord describing a knowledge tool behavior they desire to implement over the next month, I am specifically looking for measurable objectives
    - At this time people can define what tools they want to use
