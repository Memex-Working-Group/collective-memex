## Engineering Overview

This is effectively a data ops problem, and we can look at data ops patterns for concerns. Stuff like the [medallion lakehouse architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/medallion). 

Also a protocol problem, and we can look at Paul's protocol evaluation criteria for insights. 

Maybe we can distinguish the personal context vs sharable context as two problem spaces and what implications arise, as well as the system architecture for AI Agents integrations. 

To be explored soon, both:
- I know what goes here, just haven't written it yet
- I'm still figuring out what belongs here.
